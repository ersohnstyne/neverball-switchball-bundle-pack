Before you can upload to the directory (such as "map-switchball" or "map-sb"), ensure that the templates are correctly installed.

If you done this level, you can upload the *.map file to the directory "data/map-switchball" or "data/map-sb" and create pull request. Forked repositories will merge directly to me, once you've send.

Your messages will appear here once has been merged.
