# Switchball simulated objects
These are simulated objects:

## Locked Fence
Fence with locks must be placed on the bridge without rails.
If you want to add an timer, two first path corners is 0.1 seconds and idling is 4.8 seconds (eventually called 5 seconds).

Use with calculator as timed switch.

## Magnet transport
Transport must be placed only large intersections.

To install transporters, you must place only straight and never use some edges.

This transporters looks like this:

## Towers
