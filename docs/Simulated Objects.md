# Switchball simulated objects
These are simulated objects:

## Locked Fence
Fence with locks must be placed on the bridge without rails.
If you want to add an timer, two first path corners is 0.1 seconds and idling is 4.8 seconds (eventually called 5 seconds).

If you want to allocate timer range in timed switch, **use with calculator**.

## Magnet transport
Transport must be placed only large intersections.

To install transporters, you must place only straight and never use some edges.

The transport pattern looks like this:

If you want to install elevators, more than one vertical rails are needed.

**NOTE:** Maximum vertical speed is up to 15 km/h. If you use the large floors, more rails is required that can attach, but polygon elevator floors such hollow are not allowed.

## Towers
Towers must be placed on static floors or large intersections for best decorations.

The placement pattern looks like this:
