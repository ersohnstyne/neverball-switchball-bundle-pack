# Setting up the Level editor
Download the bundle pack first and then extract to the game data folder:
neverball-application/data/your-bundle-pack.zip

This template directory will be called:
data/template-switchball

You need the latest Neverball version and the NetRadiant build.

If you don't have it:
* Get [Neverball 1.7 (Microsoft Windows)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xHGWuAjGIYmXtqUQTMPH9n7PbWuyfKGE/view?usp=sharing). If you're not ready, you can download it [here](https://neverball.org/download.php).
* Get [NetRadiant 32-bit](http://ingar.intranifty.net/gtkradiant/)

And obviously check back into Neverball editor where you just get started:
* [Asset creation](https://github.com/Neverball/neverball-docs)
