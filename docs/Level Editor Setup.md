# Setting up the Level editor
Download the bundle pack first and then extract to the game data folder:
neverball-application/data/your-bundle-pack.zip

This template directory will be called:
data/template-switchball

You need the latest Neverball version and the NetRadiant build.

If you don't have it:
* Either get [Neverball 1.7 (Google Drive)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xHGWuAjGIYmXtqUQTMPH9n7PbWuyfKGE/view?usp=sharing), or get the future mapc version from [Pennyball Discord server](https://discord.gg/qnJR263Hm2), if you want to create the campaign level.
* Get [NetRadiant](https://netradiant.gitlab.io/page/download/). x64-bit or Amd64 requires high spec computers, but x86 on your system type might crash the application.

And obviously check back into Neverball editor where you just get started:
