# Setting up the Level editor
Download the bundle pack first and then extract to the game data folder:
neverball-application/data/your-bundle-pack.zip

This template directory will be called:
data/template-switchball

You need the latest Neverball version and the NetRadiant build.

If you don't have it:
* Get the future mapc version from [Pennyball Discord server](https://discord.gg/qnJR263Hm2), if you want to create the campaign level. If you're using Neverball 1.6 or earlier, you'll not be able to get these checkpoints in the future after compiled SOL file.
* Get [NetRadiant](https://netradiant.gitlab.io/page/download/). x64-bit or Amd64 requires high spec computers, but x86 on your system type might crash the application.

And obviously check back into Neverball editor where you just get started:
