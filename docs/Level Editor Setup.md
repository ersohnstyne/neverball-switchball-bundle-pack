# Setting up the Level editor
Download the bundle pack first and then extract to the game data folder:
neverball-application/data/your-bundle-pack.zip

This template directory will be called:
data/template-switchball

You need the latest Neverball version and the NetRadiant build.

If you don't have it:
* Get [Neverball 1.6](https://neverball.org/download.php)
* Get [NetRadiant](http://ingar.intranifty.net/gtkradiant/)

And obviously check back into Neverball editor where you just get started:
* [Asset creation](https://github.com/Neverball/neverball-docs)
